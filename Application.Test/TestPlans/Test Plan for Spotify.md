**Test Plan for Spotify**

**Introduction:**

This document presents the test plan for Spotify's application, with the primary goal of verifying that the core functionalities operate as intended and meet both functional and non-functional requirements.

**Scope of Work:**

1.To Be Tested:

- Login/Logout: Positive and negative test cases to ensure proper functionality, including:

    Valid and invalid login attempts.

    Successful logout functionality.

    Handling incorrect credentials, locked accounts, and password recovery.

- Registration/Sign-in: Positive and negative scenarios for:

    Valid account creation using email

    Invalid registration scenarios such as existing emails, weak passwords, or missing required fields.

2.Not to Be Tested:

- Third-party systems (e.g., payment gateways, hardware integrations).

- Backend services such as database configuration or server infrastructure.

**Quality and Acceptance Criteria:**

- Usability: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.

- Performance: The website must load efficiently across different devices and browsers.

- Security: Proper encryption should be in place, and sensitive data like login credentials should not be exposed.

- Compatibility: The website should function correctly across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

- Functionality: All core features (login, registration, music streaming, playlist management) must perform as expected without bugs or failures.

**Critical Success Factors:**

- No critical issues in the login, registration, or music streaming functionalities.

- Browser compatibility across all major platforms must be maintained.

- Zero downtime during testing phases, with all core services (user login, music playback) functioning without major disruption.

- Full coverage of both positive and negative test scenarios for critical user interactions.

**Risk Assessment:**

- Potential Risks:

    - Inconsistent behavior across different web browsers or screen resolutions.
        Probability: Medium 
        Impact: High
        Mitigation Strategies:Regular cross-browser testing during development and QA phases.

    - Delays due to resource availability or team absenteeism.
        Probability: Medium 
        Impact: Medium
        Mitigation Strategies:Establishing clear communication and backup planning for any team member unavailability.

    - Possible issues with third-party components (e.g., social media logins, API failures).
        Probability: Low 
        Impact: Low
        Mitigation Strategies:Proactive monitoring of third-party component integration with contingency plans.

**Resources:**

1.Key Project Resources:

- Testers: To resolve issues found during the testing process.

- Test Leads: To manage test case execution and coordination across the QA team.


2.Test Team:

- Automation Testers to develop and maintain automated test scripts.

- Test Lead

3.Test Environment:

- The test environment must closely resemble the production environment, with consistent data sets and access to third-party components.

- Testing should be performed on multiple devices and operating systems to ensure broad compatibility.

3.1.Test Tools:

- Jira

- Selenium

**Test Documentation and Deliverables:**

- Test Cases: Detailed test cases covering all functionalities, including positive and negative scenarios.

- Defect Reports: Categorized by severity, logged in Jira for tracking and resolution.

- Test Execution Report: Documenting the status of test cases (pass, fail, blocked) for both manual and automated tests.

- Final Test Summary Report: A high-level overview of testing activities, defect rates, and overall quality assessment.

**Test Strategy:**

- Manual Testing: Initial testing will be performed manually to identify functional issues in core features (login, registration, streaming).

- Automated Testing: Regression testing will be automated for repeated functionality checks on critical paths such as login, music playback, and playlist management.

- Exploratory Testing: Performed to discover potential issues that may not be covered by predefined test cases.

- Cross-Browser Testing: Testing will be done on multiple browsers to ensure compatibility.

**Test Schedule:**

- Test Planning

- Test Case Development

- Manual Test Execution	

- Automated Test Execution	

- Bug Fixes & Retesting	

- Final Review

**Metrics:**

- Test Case Execution Rate: Percentage of test cases completed within the planned timeframe.

- Defect Density: The number of defects identified per module or functional area.

- Test Coverage: Percentage of total features tested against the scope.

- Pass/Fail Ratio: The number of test cases that passed versus those that failed.

- Defect Fix Rate: The ratio of defects identified to defects resolved within a given period.
